Salutations.

You may be wondering why I've called you here.

Your task is to build a neural net capable of inpainting water currents,
using the data set and code base provided.

We didn't test much of this, and our results are dubious so far.

The paper about this will be groundbreaking if you are able to get things working. 
Like Nobel Peace Prize worthy.

Collect data, train some different models with the parameters in the .yaml file,
and - most importantly - have fun!
