THE PROLOGUE<br>
============<br>
[Enter Chorus.]<br>
<br>
<br>
Two households, both alike in dignity<br>
(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;<br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-marked love<br>
And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
The which, if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
[Chorus exits.]<br>

<br>
Scene 1<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Sampson and Gregory, with swords and bucklers,<br>
of the house of Capulet.]<br>
<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  Gregory, on my word we'll not carry coals.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  No, for then we should be colliers.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of<br>
collar.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  I strike quickly, being moved.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  But thou art not quickly moved to strike.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  A dog of the house of Montague moves me.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to<br>
stand. Therefore if thou art moved thou runn'st<br>
away.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I<br>
will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest<br>
goes to the wall.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  'Tis true, and therefore women, being the<br>
weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore<br>
I will push Montague's men from the wall and<br>
thrust his maids to the wall.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  The quarrel is between our masters and us<br>
their men.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant.<br>
When I have fought with the men, I will be civil<br>
with the maids; I will cut off their heads.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  The heads of the maids?<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.<br>
Take it in what sense thou wilt.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  They must take it in sense that feel it.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  Me they shall feel while I am able to stand,<br>
and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou<br>
hadst been poor-john. Draw thy tool. Here comes<br>
of the house of Montagues.<br>
<br>
[Enter Abram with another Servingman.]<br>
<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  My naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back<br>
thee.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  How? Turn thy back and run?<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  Fear me not.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  No, marry. I fear thee!<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  Let us take the law of our sides; let them<br>
begin.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it<br>
as they list.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at<br>
them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.<br>
[He bites his thumb.]<br>
<br>
ABRAM  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  I do bite my thumb, sir.<br>
<br>
ABRAM  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<br>
<br>
SAMPSON, [aside to Gregory]  Is the law of our side if I<br>
say "Ay"?<br>
<br>
GREGORY, [aside to Sampson]  No.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,<br>
but I bite my thumb, sir.<br>
<br>
GREGORY  Do you quarrel, sir?<br>
<br>
ABRAM  Quarrel, sir? No, sir.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as<br>
good a man as you.<br>
<br>
ABRAM  No better.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  Well, sir.<br>
<br>
[Enter Benvolio.]<br>
<br>
<br>
GREGORY, [aside to Sampson]  Say "better"; here comes<br>
one of my master's kinsmen.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  Yes, better, sir.<br>
<br>
ABRAM  You lie.<br>
<br>
SAMPSON  Draw if you be men.--Gregory, remember<br>
thy washing blow.	[They fight.]<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Part, fools!	[Drawing his sword.]<br>
Put up your swords. You know not what you do.<br>
<br>
[Enter Tybalt, drawing his sword.]<br>
<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?<br>
Turn thee, Benvolio; look upon thy death.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,<br>
Or manage it to part these men with me.<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
What, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word<br>
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.<br>
Have at thee, coward!	[They fight.]<br>
<br>
[Enter three or four Citizens with clubs or partisans.]<br>
<br>
<br>
CITIZENS<br>
Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!<br>
Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!<br>
<br>
[Enter old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.]<br>
<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a<br>
sword?<br>
<br>
[Enter old Montague and his Wife.]<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
My sword, I say. Old Montague is come<br>
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.<br>
<br>
MONTAGUE<br>
Thou villain Capulet!--Hold me not; let me go.<br>
<br>
LADY MONTAGUE<br>
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.<br>
<br>
[Enter Prince Escalus with his train.]<br>
<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br>
Profaners of this neighbor-stained steel--<br>
Will they not hear?--What ho! You men, you beasts,<br>
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br>
With purple fountains issuing from your veins:<br>
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br>
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,<br>
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br>
Three civil brawls bred of an airy word<br>
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br>
Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets<br>
And made Verona's ancient citizens<br>
Cast by their grave-beseeming ornaments<br>
To wield old partisans in hands as old,<br>
Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.<br>
If ever you disturb our streets again,<br>
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br>
For this time all the rest depart away.<br>
You, Capulet, shall go along with me,<br>
And, Montague, come you this afternoon<br>
To know our farther pleasure in this case,<br>
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.<br>
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.<br>
[All but Montague, Lady Montague,<br>
and Benvolio exit.]<br>
<br>
MONTAGUE, [to Benvolio]<br>
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?<br>
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Here were the servants of your adversary,<br>
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.<br>
I drew to part them. In the instant came<br>
The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,<br>
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,<br>
He swung about his head and cut the winds,<br>
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.<br>
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows<br>
Came more and more and fought on part and part,<br>
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.<br>
<br>
LADY MONTAGUE<br>
O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?<br>
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Madam, an hour before the worshiped sun<br>
Peered forth the golden window of the east,<br>
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad,<br>
Where underneath the grove of sycamore<br>
That westward rooteth from this city side,<br>
So early walking did I see your son.<br>
Towards him I made, but he was 'ware of me<br>
And stole into the covert of the wood.<br>
I, measuring his affections by my own<br>
(Which then most sought where most might not be<br>
found,<br>
Being one too many by my weary self),<br>
Pursued my humor, not pursuing his,<br>
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.<br>
<br>
MONTAGUE<br>
Many a morning hath he there been seen,<br>
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,<br>
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.<br>
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<br>
Should in the farthest east begin to draw<br>
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,<br>
Away from light steals home my heavy son<br>
And private in his chamber pens himself,<br>
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,<br>
And makes himself an artificial night.<br>
Black and portentous must this humor prove,<br>
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?<br>
<br>
MONTAGUE<br>
I neither know it nor can learn of him.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Have you importuned him by any means?<br>
<br>
MONTAGUE<br>
Both by myself and many other friends.<br>
But he, his own affections' counselor,<br>
Is to himself--I will not say how true,<br>
But to himself so secret and so close,<br>
So far from sounding and discovery,<br>
As is the bud bit with an envious worm<br>
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air<br>
Or dedicate his beauty to the same.<br>
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,<br>
We would as willingly give cure as know.<br>
<br>
[Enter Romeo.]<br>
<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.<br>
I'll know his grievance or be much denied.<br>
<br>
MONTAGUE<br>
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay<br>
To hear true shrift.--Come, madam, let's away.<br>
[Montague and Lady Montague exit.]<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Good morrow, cousin.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Is the day so young?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
But new struck nine.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Ay me, sad hours seem long.<br>
Was that my father that went hence so fast?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Not having that which, having, makes them short.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  In love?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Out--<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Of love?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Out of her favor where I am in love.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Alas that love, so gentle in his view,<br>
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,<br>
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!<br>
Where shall we dine?--O me! What fray was here?<br>
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.<br>
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.<br>
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,<br>
O anything of nothing first create!<br>
O heavy lightness, serious vanity,<br>
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,<br>
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,<br>
Still-waking sleep that is not what it is!<br>
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.<br>
Dost thou not laugh?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  No, coz, I rather weep.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Good heart, at what?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  At thy good heart's oppression.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Why, such is love's transgression.<br>
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<br>
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed<br>
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown<br>
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<br>
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;<br>
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;<br>
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.<br>
What is it else? A madness most discreet,<br>
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.<br>
Farewell, my coz.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Soft, I will go along.<br>
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.<br>
This is not Romeo. He's some other where.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  What, shall I groan and tell thee?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Groan? Why, no. But sadly tell me who.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
A sick man in sadness makes his will--<br>
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.<br>
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
A right good markman! And she's fair I love.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Well in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit<br>
With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,<br>
And, in strong proof of chastity well armed,<br>
From love's weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.<br>
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,<br>
Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,<br>
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.<br>
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor<br>
That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;<br>
For beauty, starved with her severity,<br>
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<br>
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,<br>
To merit bliss by making me despair.<br>
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<br>
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
O, teach me how I should forget to think!<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.<br>
Examine other beauties.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  'Tis the way<br>
To call hers, exquisite, in question more.<br>
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,<br>
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.<br>
He that is strucken blind cannot forget<br>
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.<br>
Show me a mistress that is passing fair;<br>
What doth her beauty serve but as a note<br>
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?<br>
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
I'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.<br>
[They exit.]<br>
<br>
Scene 2<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Capulet, County Paris, and a Servingman.]<br>
<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
But Montague is bound as well as I,<br>
In penalty alike, and 'tis not hard, I think,<br>
For men so old as we to keep the peace.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Of honorable reckoning are you both,<br>
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.<br>
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
But saying o'er what I have said before.<br>
My child is yet a stranger in the world.<br>
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.<br>
Let two more summers wither in their pride<br>
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Younger than she are happy mothers made.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
And too soon marred are those so early made.<br>
Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;<br>
She's the hopeful lady of my earth.<br>
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;<br>
My will to her consent is but a part.<br>
And, she agreed, within her scope of choice<br>
Lies my consent and fair according voice.<br>
This night I hold an old accustomed feast,<br>
Whereto I have invited many a guest<br>
Such as I love; and you among the store,<br>
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.<br>
At my poor house look to behold this night<br>
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.<br>
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel<br>
When well-appareled April on the heel<br>
Of limping winter treads, even such delight<br>
Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night<br>
Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,<br>
And like her most whose merit most shall be;<br>
Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,<br>
May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.<br>
Come go with me.	[To Servingman, giving him a list.]<br>
Go, sirrah, trudge about<br>
Through fair Verona, find those persons out<br>
Whose names are written there, and to them say<br>
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.<br>
[Capulet and Paris exit.]<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  Find them out whose names are written<br>
here! It is written that the shoemaker should<br>
meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the<br>
fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.<br>
But I am sent to find those persons whose names<br>
are here writ, and can never find what names the<br>
writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned.<br>
In good time!<br>
<br>
[Enter Benvolio and Romeo.]<br>
<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO, [to Romeo]<br>
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;<br>
One pain is lessened by another's anguish.<br>
Turn giddy, and be helped by backward turning.<br>
One desperate grief cures with another's languish.<br>
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,<br>
And the rank poison of the old will die.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
For what, I pray thee?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  For your broken shin.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Why Romeo, art thou mad?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is,<br>
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,<br>
Whipped and tormented, and--good e'en, good<br>
fellow.<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  God gi' good e'en. I pray, sir, can you<br>
read?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  Perhaps you have learned it without<br>
book. But I pray, can you read anything you see?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  You say honestly. Rest you merry.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Stay, fellow. I can read.	[(He reads the letter.)]<br>
Signior Martino and his wife and daughters,<br>
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters,<br>
The lady widow of Vitruvio,<br>
Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces,<br>
Mercutio and his brother Valentine,<br>
Mine Uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters,<br>
My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,<br>
Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt,<br>
Lucio and the lively Helena.<br>
A fair assembly. Whither should they come?<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  Up.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Whither? To supper?<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  To our house.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Whose house?<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  My master's.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Indeed I should have asked thee that before.<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  Now I'll tell you without asking. My<br>
master is the great rich Capulet, and, if you be not<br>
of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a<br>
cup of wine. Rest you merry.	[He exits.]<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's<br>
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves,<br>
With all the admired beauties of Verona.<br>
Go thither, and with unattainted eye<br>
Compare her face with some that I shall show,<br>
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
When the devout religion of mine eye<br>
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;<br>
And these who, often drowned, could never die,<br>
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.<br>
One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun<br>
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,<br>
Herself poised with herself in either eye;<br>
But in that crystal scales let there be weighed<br>
Your lady's love against some other maid<br>
That I will show you shining at this feast,<br>
And she shall scant show well that now seems best.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,<br>
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.<br>
[They exit.]<br>
<br>
Scene 3<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.]<br>
<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,<br>
I bade her come.--What, lamb! What, ladybird!<br>
God forbid. Where's this girl? What, Juliet!<br>
<br>
[Enter Juliet.]<br>
<br>
<br>
JULIET  How now, who calls?<br>
<br>
NURSE  Your mother.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Madam, I am here. What is your will?<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
This is the matter.--Nurse, give leave awhile.<br>
We must talk in secret.--Nurse, come back again.<br>
I have remembered me, thou 's hear our counsel.<br>
Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET  She's not fourteen.<br>
<br>
NURSE  I'll lay fourteen of my teeth (and yet, to my teen<br>
be it spoken, I have but four) she's not fourteen.<br>
How long is it now to Lammastide?<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET  A fortnight and odd days.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Even or odd, of all days in the year,<br>
Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.<br>
Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)<br>
Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;<br>
She was too good for me. But, as I said,<br>
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.<br>
That shall she. Marry, I remember it well.<br>
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,<br>
And she was weaned (I never shall forget it)<br>
Of all the days of the year, upon that day.<br>
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,<br>
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.<br>
My lord and you were then at Mantua.<br>
Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,<br>
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple<br>
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,<br>
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug.<br>
"Shake," quoth the dovehouse. 'Twas no need, I<br>
trow,<br>
To bid me trudge.<br>
And since that time it is eleven years.<br>
For then she could stand high-lone. Nay, by th'<br>
rood,<br>
She could have run and waddled all about,<br>
For even the day before, she broke her brow,<br>
And then my husband (God be with his soul,<br>
He was a merry man) took up the child.<br>
"Yea," quoth he, "Dost thou fall upon thy face?<br>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,<br>
Wilt thou not, Jule?" And, by my holidam,<br>
The pretty wretch left crying and said "Ay."<br>
To see now how a jest shall come about!<br>
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,<br>
I never should forget it. "Wilt thou not, Jule?"<br>
quoth he.<br>
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said "Ay."<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh<br>
To think it should leave crying and say "Ay."<br>
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow<br>
A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone,<br>
A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.<br>
"Yea," quoth my husband. "Fall'st upon thy face?<br>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,<br>
Wilt thou not, Jule?" It stinted and said "Ay."<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
And stint thou, too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Peace. I have done. God mark thee to his grace,<br>
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.<br>
An I might live to see thee married once,<br>
I have my wish.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme<br>
I came to talk of.--Tell me, daughter Juliet,<br>
How stands your disposition to be married?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
It is an honor that I dream not of.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
An honor? Were not I thine only nurse,<br>
I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy<br>
teat.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you<br>
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,<br>
Are made already mothers. By my count<br>
I was your mother much upon these years<br>
That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief:<br>
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
A man, young lady--lady, such a man<br>
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Nay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
What say you? Can you love the gentleman?<br>
This night you shall behold him at our feast.<br>
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,<br>
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen.<br>
Examine every married lineament<br>
And see how one another lends content,<br>
And what obscured in this fair volume lies<br>
Find written in the margent of his eyes.<br>
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,<br>
To beautify him only lacks a cover.<br>
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride<br>
For fair without the fair within to hide.<br>
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory<br>
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story.<br>
So shall you share all that he doth possess<br>
By having him, making yourself no less.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
No less? Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Speak briefly. Can you like of Paris' love?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
I'll look to like, if looking liking move.<br>
But no more deep will I endart mine eye<br>
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.<br>
<br>
[Enter Servingman.]<br>
<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  Madam, the guests are come, supper<br>
served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the<br>
Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in<br>
extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you,<br>
follow straight.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
We follow thee.	[Servingman exits.]<br>
Juliet, the County stays.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.<br>
[They exit.]<br>
<br>
Scene 4<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other<br>
Maskers, Torchbearers, and a Boy with a drum.]<br>
<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?<br>
Or shall we on without apology?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
The date is out of such prolixity.<br>
We'll have no Cupid hoodwinked with a scarf,<br>
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,<br>
Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper,<br>
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke<br>
After the prompter, for our entrance.<br>
But let them measure us by what they will.<br>
We'll measure them a measure and be gone.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.<br>
Being but heavy I will bear the light.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes<br>
With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead<br>
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings<br>
And soar with them above a common bound.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft<br>
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound<br>
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.<br>
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
And to sink in it should you burden love--<br>
Too great oppression for a tender thing.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,<br>
Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.<br>
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.--<br>
Give me a case to put my visage in.--<br>
A visor for a visor. What care I<br>
What curious eye doth cote deformities?<br>
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Come, knock and enter, and no sooner in<br>
But every man betake him to his legs.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
A torch for me. Let wantons light of heart<br>
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,<br>
For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase:<br>
I'll be a candle holder and look on;<br>
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word.<br>
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire--<br>
Or, save your reverence, love--wherein thou<br>
stickest<br>
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Nay, that's not so.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  I mean, sir, in delay<br>
We waste our lights; in vain, light lights by day.<br>
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits<br>
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
And we mean well in going to this masque,<br>
But 'tis no wit to go.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Why, may one ask?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I dreamt a dream tonight.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  And so did I.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Well, what was yours?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  That dreamers often lie.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
In bed asleep while they do dream things true.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<br>
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes<br>
In shape no bigger than an agate stone<br>
On the forefinger of an alderman,<br>
Drawn with a team of little atomi<br>
Over men's noses as they lie asleep.<br>
Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,<br>
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,<br>
Her traces of the smallest spider web,<br>
Her collars of the moonshine's wat'ry beams,<br>
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,<br>
Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,<br>
Not half so big as a round little worm<br>
Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.<br>
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,<br>
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br>
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.<br>
And in this state she gallops night by night<br>
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;<br>
On courtiers' knees, that dream on cur'sies straight;<br>
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br>
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br>
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues<br>
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.<br>
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,<br>
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.<br>
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,<br>
Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep;<br>
Then he dreams of another benefice.<br>
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,<br>
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br>
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br>
Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon<br>
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes<br>
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two<br>
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br>
That plats the manes of horses in the night<br>
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,<br>
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.<br>
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,<br>
That presses them and learns them first to bear,<br>
Making them women of good carriage.<br>
This is she--<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.<br>
Thou talk'st of nothing.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  True, I talk of dreams,<br>
Which are the children of an idle brain,<br>
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,<br>
Which is as thin of substance as the air<br>
And more inconstant than the wind, who woos<br>
Even now the frozen bosom of the north<br>
And, being angered, puffs away from thence,<br>
Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.<br>
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I fear too early, for my mind misgives<br>
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars<br>
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date<br>
With this night's revels, and expire the term<br>
Of a despised life closed in my breast<br>
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.<br>
But he that hath the steerage of my course<br>
Direct my sail. On, lusty gentlemen.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Strike, drum.<br>
[They march about the stage<br>
and then withdraw to the side.]<br>
<br>
Scene 5<br>
=======<br>
[Servingmen come forth with napkins.]<br>
<br>
<br>
FIRST SERVINGMAN  Where's Potpan that he helps not<br>
to take away? He shift a trencher? He scrape a<br>
trencher?<br>
<br>
SECOND SERVINGMAN  When good manners shall lie<br>
all in one or two men's hands, and they unwashed<br>
too, 'tis a foul thing.<br>
<br>
FIRST SERVINGMAN  Away with the joint stools, remove<br>
the court cupboard, look to the plate.--<br>
Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as<br>
thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone<br>
and Nell.--Anthony and Potpan!<br>
<br>
THIRD SERVINGMAN  Ay, boy, ready.<br>
<br>
FIRST SERVINGMAN  You are looked for and called for,<br>
asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.<br>
<br>
THIRD SERVINGMAN  We cannot be here and there too.<br>
Cheerly, boys! Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver<br>
take all.	[They move aside.]<br>
<br>
[Enter Capulet and his household, all the guests and<br>
gentlewomen to Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, and the<br>
other Maskers.]<br>
<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Welcome, gentlemen. Ladies that have their toes<br>
Unplagued with corns will walk a bout with<br>
you.--<br>
Ah, my mistresses, which of you all<br>
Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,<br>
She, I'll swear, hath corns. Am I come near you<br>
now?--<br>
Welcome, gentlemen. I have seen the day<br>
That I have worn a visor and could tell<br>
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,<br>
Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone.<br>
You are welcome, gentlemen.--Come, musicians,<br>
play.	[Music plays and they dance.]<br>
A hall, a hall, give room!--And foot it, girls.--<br>
More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up,<br>
And quench the fire; the room is grown too hot.--<br>
Ah, sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes well.--<br>
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,<br>
For you and I are past our dancing days.<br>
How long is 't now since last yourself and I<br>
Were in a mask?<br>
<br>
CAPULET'S COUSIN  By 'r Lady, thirty years.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
What, man, 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much.<br>
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,<br>
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,<br>
Some five and twenty years, and then we masked.<br>
<br>
CAPULET'S COUSIN<br>
'Tis more, 'tis more. His son is elder, sir.<br>
His son is thirty.<br>
<br>
CAPULET  Will you tell me that?<br>
His son was but a ward two years ago.<br>
<br>
ROMEO, [to a Servingman]<br>
What lady's that which doth enrich the hand<br>
Of yonder knight?<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  I know not, sir.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!<br>
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night<br>
As a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear--<br>
Beauty too rich for use, for Earth too dear.<br>
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows<br>
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.<br>
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand<br>
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.<br>
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight,<br>
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.--<br>
Fetch me my rapier, boy.	[Page exits.]<br>
What, dares the slave<br>
Come hither covered with an antic face<br>
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?<br>
Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,<br>
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,<br>
A villain that is hither come in spite<br>
To scorn at our solemnity this night.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Young Romeo is it?<br>
<br>
TYBALT  'Tis he, that villain Romeo.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Content thee, gentle coz. Let him alone.<br>
He bears him like a portly gentleman,<br>
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him<br>
To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.<br>
I would not for the wealth of all this town<br>
Here in my house do him disparagement.<br>
Therefore be patient. Take no note of him.<br>
It is my will, the which if thou respect,<br>
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,<br>
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
It fits when such a villain is a guest.<br>
I'll not endure him.<br>
<br>
CAPULET  He shall be endured.<br>
What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to.<br>
Am I the master here or you? Go to.<br>
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,<br>
You'll make a mutiny among my guests,<br>
You will set cock-a-hoop, you'll be the man!<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.<br>
<br>
CAPULET  Go to, go to.<br>
You are a saucy boy. Is 't so indeed?<br>
This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.<br>
You must contrary me. Marry, 'tis time--<br>
Well said, my hearts.--You are a princox, go.<br>
Be quiet, or--More light, more light!--for shame,<br>
I'll make you quiet.--What, cheerly, my hearts!<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
Patience perforce with willful choler meeting<br>
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.<br>
I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,<br>
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.<br>
[He exits.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO, [taking Juliet's hand]<br>
If I profane with my unworthiest hand<br>
This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:<br>
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand<br>
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,<br>
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;<br>
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,<br>
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.<br>
They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.<br>
[He kisses her.]<br>
Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged!<br>
Give me my sin again.	[He kisses her.]<br>
<br>
JULIET  You kiss by th' book.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.<br>
[Juliet moves toward her mother.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
What is her mother?<br>
<br>
NURSE  Marry, bachelor,<br>
Her mother is the lady of the house,<br>
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.<br>
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.<br>
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her<br>
Shall have the chinks.	[Nurse moves away.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO, [aside]  Is she a Capulet?<br>
O dear account! My life is my foe's debt.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Away, begone. The sport is at the best.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.<br>
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.--<br>
Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.<br>
I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.--<br>
More torches here.--Come on then, let's to bed.--<br>
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late.<br>
I'll to my rest.<br>
[All but Juliet and the Nurse begin to exit.]<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
The son and heir of old Tiberio.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
What's he that now is going out of door?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
What's he that follows here, that would not dance?<br>
<br>
NURSE  I know not.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Go ask his name. [The Nurse goes.] If he be married,<br>
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.<br>
<br>
NURSE, [returning]<br>
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,<br>
The only son of your great enemy.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
My only love sprung from my only hate!<br>
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!<br>
Prodigious birth of love it is to me<br>
That I must love a loathed enemy.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
What's this? What's this?<br>
<br>
JULIET  A rhyme I learned even now<br>
Of one I danced withal.<br>
[One calls within "Juliet."]<br>
<br>
NURSE  Anon, anon.<br>
Come, let's away. The strangers all are gone.<br>
[They exit.]<br>

ACT 2<br>
=====<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Enter Chorus.]<br>
<br>
<br>
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,<br>
And young affection gapes to be his heir.<br>
That fair for which love groaned for and would die,<br>
With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair.<br>
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,<br>
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks,<br>
But to his foe supposed he must complain,<br>
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.<br>
Being held a foe, he may not have access<br>
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,<br>
And she as much in love, her means much less<br>
To meet her new beloved anywhere.<br>
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,<br>
Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.<br>
[Chorus exits.]<br>
<br>
Scene 1<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Romeo alone.]<br>
<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Can I go forward when my heart is here?<br>
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy center out.<br>
[He withdraws.]<br>
<br>
[Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.]<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Romeo, my cousin Romeo, Romeo!<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  He is wise<br>
And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.<br>
Call, good Mercutio.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Nay, I'll conjure too.<br>
Romeo! Humors! Madman! Passion! Lover!<br>
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh.<br>
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied.<br>
Cry but "Ay me," pronounce but "love" and<br>
"dove."<br>
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,<br>
One nickname for her purblind son and heir,<br>
Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim<br>
When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid.--<br>
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.<br>
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.--<br>
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,<br>
By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip,<br>
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,<br>
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,<br>
That in thy likeness thou appear to us.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him<br>
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle<br>
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand<br>
Till she had laid it and conjured it down.<br>
That were some spite. My invocation<br>
Is fair and honest. In his mistress' name,<br>
I conjure only but to raise up him.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees<br>
To be consorted with the humorous night.<br>
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.<br>
Now will he sit under a medlar tree<br>
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit<br>
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.--<br>
O Romeo, that she were, O, that she were<br>
An open-arse, thou a pop'rin pear.<br>
Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle bed;<br>
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.--<br>
Come, shall we go?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Go, then, for 'tis in vain<br>
To seek him here that means not to be found.<br>
[They exit.]<br>
<br>
Scene 2<br>
=======<br>
[Romeo comes forward.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.<br>
<br>
[Enter Juliet above.]<br>
<br>
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?<br>
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.<br>
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,<br>
Who is already sick and pale with grief<br>
That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.<br>
Be not her maid since she is envious.<br>
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,<br>
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.<br>
It is my lady. O, it is my love!<br>
O, that she knew she were!<br>
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?<br>
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.<br>
I am too bold. 'Tis not to me she speaks.<br>
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<br>
Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br>
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br>
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br>
The brightness of her cheek would shame those<br>
stars<br>
As daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven<br>
Would through the airy region stream so bright<br>
That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br>
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.<br>
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,<br>
That I might touch that cheek!<br>
<br>
JULIET  Ay me.<br>
<br>
ROMEO, [aside]  She speaks.<br>
O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art<br>
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,<br>
As is a winged messenger of heaven<br>
Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes<br>
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<br>
When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds<br>
And sails upon the bosom of the air.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?<br>
Deny thy father and refuse thy name,<br>
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br>
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.<br>
<br>
ROMEO, [aside]<br>
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.<br>
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br>
What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,<br>
Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name<br>
Belonging to a man.<br>
What's in a name? That which we call a rose<br>
By any other word would smell as sweet.<br>
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,<br>
Retain that dear perfection which he owes<br>
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,<br>
And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,<br>
Take all myself.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  I take thee at thy word.<br>
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized.<br>
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night,<br>
So stumblest on my counsel?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  By a name<br>
I know not how to tell thee who I am.<br>
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself<br>
Because it is an enemy to thee.<br>
Had I it written, I would tear the word.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words<br>
Of thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound.<br>
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?<br>
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,<br>
And the place death, considering who thou art,<br>
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls,<br>
For stony limits cannot hold love out,<br>
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.<br>
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye<br>
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,<br>
And I am proof against their enmity.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
I would not for the world they saw thee here.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes,<br>
And, but thou love me, let them find me here.<br>
My life were better ended by their hate<br>
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.<br>
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.<br>
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far<br>
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,<br>
I should adventure for such merchandise.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,<br>
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek<br>
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.<br>
Fain would I dwell on form; fain, fain deny<br>
What I have spoke. But farewell compliment.<br>
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say "Ay,"<br>
And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,<br>
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,<br>
They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br>
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.<br>
Or, if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,<br>
I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,<br>
So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.<br>
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,<br>
And therefore thou mayst think my havior light.<br>
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true<br>
Than those that have more coying to be strange.<br>
I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br>
But that thou overheard'st ere I was ware<br>
My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,<br>
And not impute this yielding to light love,<br>
Which the dark night hath so discovered.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,<br>
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,<br>
That monthly changes in her circled orb,<br>
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
What shall I swear by?<br>
<br>
JULIET  Do not swear at all.<br>
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,<br>
Which is the god of my idolatry,<br>
And I'll believe thee.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  If my heart's dear love--<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,<br>
I have no joy of this contract tonight.<br>
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,<br>
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br>
Ere one can say "It lightens." Sweet, good night.<br>
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,<br>
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.<br>
Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest<br>
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it,<br>
And yet I would it were to give again.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
But to be frank and give it thee again.<br>
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.<br>
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,<br>
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,<br>
The more I have, for both are infinite.<br>
[Nurse calls from within.]<br>
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.--<br>
Anon, good nurse.--Sweet Montague, be true.<br>
Stay but a little; I will come again.	[She exits.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,<br>
Being in night, all this is but a dream,<br>
Too flattering sweet to be substantial.<br>
<br>
[Reenter Juliet above.]<br>
<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.<br>
If that thy bent of love be honorable,<br>
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,<br>
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,<br>
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,<br>
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay<br>
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.<br>
<br>
NURSE, [within]  Madam.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
I come anon.--But if thou meanest not well,<br>
I do beseech thee--<br>
<br>
NURSE, [within]  Madam.<br>
<br>
JULIET  By and by, I come.--<br>
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.<br>
Tomorrow will I send.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  So thrive my soul--<br>
<br>
JULIET  A thousand times good night.	[She exits.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.<br>
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their<br>
books,<br>
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.<br>
[Going.]<br>
<br>
[Enter Juliet above again.]<br>
<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Hist, Romeo, hist! O, for a falc'ner's voice<br>
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!<br>
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,<br>
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies<br>
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine<br>
With repetition of "My Romeo!"<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
It is my soul that calls upon my name.<br>
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,<br>
Like softest music to attending ears.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Romeo.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  My dear.<br>
<br>
JULIET  What o'clock tomorrow<br>
Shall I send to thee?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  By the hour of nine.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then.<br>
I have forgot why I did call thee back.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Let me stand here till thou remember it.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,<br>
Rememb'ring how I love thy company.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,<br>
Forgetting any other home but this.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone,<br>
And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,<br>
That lets it hop a little from his hand,<br>
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,<br>
And with a silken thread plucks it back again,<br>
So loving-jealous of his liberty.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I would I were thy bird.<br>
<br>
JULIET  Sweet, so would I.<br>
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.<br>
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet<br>
sorrow<br>
That I shall say "Good night" till it be morrow.<br>
[She exits.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.<br>
Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest.<br>
Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell,<br>
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.<br>
[He exits.]<br>
<br>
Scene 3<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Friar Lawrence alone with a basket.]<br>
<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,<br>
Check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light,<br>
And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels<br>
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.<br>
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,<br>
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,<br>
I must upfill this osier cage of ours<br>
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.<br>
The Earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;<br>
What is her burying grave, that is her womb;<br>
And from her womb children of divers kind<br>
We sucking on her natural bosom find,<br>
Many for many virtues excellent,<br>
None but for some, and yet all different.<br>
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies<br>
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.<br>
For naught so vile that on the Earth doth live<br>
But to the Earth some special good doth give;<br>
Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use,<br>
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.<br>
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,<br>
And vice sometime by action dignified.<br>
<br>
[Enter Romeo.]<br>
<br>
Within the infant rind of this weak flower<br>
Poison hath residence and medicine power:<br>
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each<br>
part;<br>
Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart.<br>
Two such opposed kings encamp them still<br>
In man as well as herbs--grace and rude will;<br>
And where the worser is predominant,<br>
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Good morrow, father.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE  Benedicite.<br>
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?<br>
Young son, it argues a distempered head<br>
So soon to bid "Good morrow" to thy bed.<br>
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,<br>
And, where care lodges, sleep will never lie;<br>
But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain<br>
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth<br>
reign.<br>
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure<br>
Thou art uproused with some distemp'rature,<br>
Or, if not so, then here I hit it right:<br>
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.<br>
I have forgot that name and that name's woe.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
That's my good son. But where hast thou been<br>
then?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.<br>
I have been feasting with mine enemy,<br>
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me<br>
That's by me wounded. Both our remedies<br>
Within thy help and holy physic lies.<br>
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,<br>
My intercession likewise steads my foe.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.<br>
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set<br>
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.<br>
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,<br>
And all combined, save what thou must combine<br>
By holy marriage. When and where and how<br>
We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow<br>
I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,<br>
That thou consent to marry us today.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!<br>
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,<br>
So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies<br>
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.<br>
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine<br>
Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!<br>
How much salt water thrown away in waste<br>
To season love, that of it doth not taste!<br>
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,<br>
Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears.<br>
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit<br>
Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.<br>
If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,<br>
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.<br>
And art thou changed? Pronounce this sentence<br>
then:<br>
Women may fall when there's no strength in men.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
And bad'st me bury love.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE  Not in a grave<br>
To lay one in, another out to have.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now<br>
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.<br>
The other did not so.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE  O, she knew well<br>
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.<br>
But come, young waverer, come, go with me.<br>
In one respect I'll thy assistant be,<br>
For this alliance may so happy prove<br>
To turn your households' rancor to pure love.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
O, let us hence. I stand on sudden haste.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.<br>
[They exit.]<br>
<br>
Scene 4<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]<br>
<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
Where the devil should this Romeo be?<br>
Came he not home tonight?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that<br>
Rosaline,<br>
Torments him so that he will sure run mad.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,<br>
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  A challenge, on my life.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Romeo will answer it.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Any man that can write may answer a letter.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how<br>
he dares, being dared.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead,<br>
stabbed with a white wench's black eye, run<br>
through the ear with a love-song, the very pin of his<br>
heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt shaft. And<br>
is he a man to encounter Tybalt?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Why, what is Tybalt?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  More than prince of cats. O, he's the courageous<br>
captain of compliments. He fights as you sing<br>
prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion.<br>
He rests his minim rests, one, two, and the third in<br>
your bosom--the very butcher of a silk button, a<br>
duelist, a duelist, a gentleman of the very first house<br>
of the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal<br>
passado, the punto reverso, the hay!<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  The what?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting<br>
phantasimes, these new tuners of accent: "By<br>
Jesu, a very good blade! A very tall man! A very good<br>
whore!" Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire,<br>
that we should be thus afflicted with these<br>
strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these "pardon-me" 's,<br>
who stand so much on the new form<br>
that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O their<br>
bones, their bones!<br>
<br>
[Enter Romeo.]<br>
<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Without his roe, like a dried herring. O<br>
flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the<br>
numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura to his lady<br>
was a kitchen wench (marry, she had a better love<br>
to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,<br>
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, Thisbe a gray<br>
eye or so, but not to the purpose.--Signior Romeo,<br>
bonjour. There's a French salutation to your French<br>
slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit<br>
did I give you?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was<br>
great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain<br>
courtesy.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  That's as much as to say such a case as<br>
yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Meaning, to curtsy.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Thou hast most kindly hit it.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  A most courteous exposition.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  "Pink" for flower.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Right.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Why, then is my pump well flowered.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Sure wit, follow me this jest now till thou<br>
hast worn out thy pump, that when the single sole<br>
of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing,<br>
solely singular.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  O single-soled jest, solely singular for the<br>
singleness.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Come between us, good Benvolio. My wits<br>
faints.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll cry<br>
a match.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I<br>
am done, for thou hast more of the wild goose in<br>
one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole<br>
five. Was I with you there for the goose?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Thou wast never with me for anything when<br>
thou wast not there for the goose.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Nay, good goose, bite not.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most<br>
sharp sauce.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  And is it not, then, well served into a sweet<br>
goose?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  O, here's a wit of cheveril that stretches<br>
from an inch narrow to an ell broad.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  I stretch it out for that word "broad," which<br>
added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a<br>
broad goose.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Why, is not this better now than groaning<br>
for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou<br>
Romeo, now art thou what thou art, by art as well as<br>
by nature. For this driveling love is like a great<br>
natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his<br>
bauble in a hole.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Stop there, stop there.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against<br>
the hair.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  O, thou art deceived. I would have made it<br>
short, for I was come to the whole depth of my tale<br>
and meant indeed to occupy the argument no<br>
longer.<br>
<br>
[Enter Nurse and her man Peter.]<br>
<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Here's goodly gear. A sail, a sail!<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Two, two--a shirt and a smock.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Peter.<br>
<br>
PETER  Anon.<br>
<br>
NURSE  My fan, Peter.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Good Peter, to hide her face, for her fan's<br>
the fairer face.<br>
<br>
NURSE  God you good morrow, gentlemen.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  God you good e'en, fair gentlewoman.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Is it good e'en?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of<br>
the dial is now upon the prick of noon.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Out upon you! What a man are you?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, himself<br>
to mar.<br>
<br>
NURSE  By my troth, it is well said: "for himself to<br>
mar," quoth he? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me<br>
where I may find the young Romeo?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older<br>
when you have found him than he was when you<br>
sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for<br>
fault of a worse.<br>
<br>
NURSE  You say well.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i'<br>
faith, wisely, wisely.<br>
<br>
NURSE  If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with<br>
you.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  She will indite him to some supper.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  A bawd, a bawd, a bawd. So ho!<br>
<br>
ROMEO  What hast thou found?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  No hare, sir, unless a hare, sir, in a Lenten<br>
pie that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.<br>
[Singing.]	An old hare hoar,<br>
	And an old hare hoar,<br>
	   Is very good meat in Lent.<br>
	But a hare that is hoar<br>
	Is too much for a score<br>
	   When it hoars ere it be spent.<br>
Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to<br>
dinner thither.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  I will follow you.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell, lady, lady,<br>
lady.	[Mercutio and Benvolio exit.]<br>
<br>
NURSE  I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this<br>
that was so full of his ropery?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself<br>
talk and will speak more in a minute than he will<br>
stand to in a month.<br>
<br>
NURSE  An he speak anything against me, I'll take him<br>
down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty<br>
such jacks. An if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.<br>
Scurvy knave, I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none<br>
of his skains-mates. [To Peter.] And thou must stand<br>
by too and suffer every knave to use me at his<br>
pleasure.<br>
<br>
PETER  I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had,<br>
my weapon should quickly have been out. I warrant<br>
you, I dare draw as soon as another man, if I<br>
see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my<br>
side.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part<br>
about me quivers. Scurvy knave! [To Romeo.] Pray<br>
you, sir, a word. And, as I told you, my young lady<br>
bid me inquire you out. What she bid me say, I will<br>
keep to myself. But first let me tell you, if you<br>
should lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it<br>
were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For<br>
the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you<br>
should deal double with her, truly it were an ill<br>
thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very<br>
weak dealing.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.<br>
I protest unto thee--<br>
<br>
NURSE  Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much.<br>
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not<br>
mark me.<br>
<br>
NURSE  I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as<br>
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Bid her devise<br>
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,<br>
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell<br>
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.<br>
[Offering her money.]<br>
<br>
NURSE  No, truly, sir, not a penny.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Go to, I say you shall.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.<br>
Within this hour my man shall be with thee<br>
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,<br>
Which to the high topgallant of my joy<br>
Must be my convoy in the secret night.<br>
Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.<br>
Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Now, God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  What sayst thou, my dear nurse?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say<br>
"Two may keep counsel, putting one away"?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord,<br>
Lord, when 'twas a little prating thing--O, there is<br>
a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay<br>
knife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief see a<br>
toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes<br>
and tell her that Paris is the properer man, but I'll<br>
warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any<br>
clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and<br>
Romeo begin both with a letter?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Ay, nurse, what of that? Both with an R.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Ah, mocker, that's the dog's name. R is for<br>
the--No, I know it begins with some other letter,<br>
and she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you<br>
and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Commend me to thy lady.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Ay, a thousand times.--Peter.<br>
<br>
PETER  Anon.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Before and apace.<br>

=======<br>
[Enter Juliet.]<br>
<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.<br>
In half an hour she promised to return.<br>
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.<br>
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,<br>
Which ten times faster glides than the sun's beams,<br>
Driving back shadows over louring hills.<br>
Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love,<br>
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.<br>
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill<br>
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve<br>
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.<br>
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,<br>
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;<br>
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,<br>
And his to me.<br>
But old folks, many feign as they were dead,<br>
Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.<br>
<br>
[Enter Nurse and Peter.]<br>
<br>
O God, she comes!--O, honey nurse, what news?<br>
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Peter, stay at the gate.	[Peter exits.]<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Now, good sweet nurse--O Lord, why lookest thou<br>
sad?<br>
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.<br>
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news<br>
By playing it to me with so sour a face.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
I am aweary. Give me leave awhile.<br>
Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I!<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.<br>
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak. Good, good nurse,<br>
speak.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?<br>
Do you not see that I am out of breath?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath<br>
To say to me that thou art out of breath?<br>
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay<br>
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.<br>
Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.<br>
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.<br>
Let me be satisfied; is 't good or bad?<br>
<br>
NURSE  Well, you have made a simple choice. You know<br>
not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he.<br>
Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg<br>
excels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a<br>
body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they<br>
are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy,<br>
but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy<br>
ways, wench. Serve God. What, have you dined at<br>
home?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
No, no. But all this did I know before.<br>
What says he of our marriage? What of that?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!<br>
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.<br>
My back o' t' other side! Ah, my back, my back!<br>
Beshrew your heart for sending me about<br>
To catch my death with jaunting up and down.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.<br>
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my<br>
love?<br>
<br>
NURSE  Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a<br>
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I<br>
warrant, a virtuous--Where is your mother?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Where is my mother? Why, she is within.<br>
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest:<br>
"Your love says, like an honest gentleman,<br>
Where is your mother?"<br>
<br>
NURSE  O God's lady dear,<br>
Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.<br>
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?<br>
Henceforward do your messages yourself.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Here's such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?<br>
<br>
JULIET  I have.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence' cell.<br>
There stays a husband to make you a wife.<br>
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks;<br>
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.<br>
Hie you to church. I must another way,<br>
To fetch a ladder by the which your love<br>
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.<br>
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,<br>
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.<br>
Go. I'll to dinner. Hie you to the cell.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.<br>
[They exit.]<br>
<br>
Scene 6<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.]<br>
<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
So smile the heavens upon this holy act<br>
That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can,<br>
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy<br>
That one short minute gives me in her sight.<br>
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,<br>
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,<br>
It is enough I may but call her mine.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
These violent delights have violent ends<br>
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,<br>
Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey<br>
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness<br>
And in the taste confounds the appetite.<br>
Therefore love moderately. Long love doth so.<br>
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.<br>
<br>
[Enter Juliet.]<br>
<br>
Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot<br>
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.<br>
A lover may bestride the gossamers<br>
That idles in the wanton summer air,<br>
And yet not fall, so light is vanity.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Good even to my ghostly confessor.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy<br>
Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more<br>
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath<br>
This neighbor air, and let rich music's tongue<br>
Unfold the imagined happiness that both<br>
Receive in either by this dear encounter.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,<br>
Brags of his substance, not of ornament.<br>
They are but beggars that can count their worth,<br>
But my true love is grown to such excess<br>
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Come, come with me, and we will make short work,<br>
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone<br>
Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.<br>
[They exit.]<br>

ACT 3<br>
=====<br>
<br>
Scene 1<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and their men.]<br>
<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.<br>
The day is hot, the Capels are abroad,<br>
And if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl,<br>
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Thou art like one of these fellows that, when<br>
he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his<br>
sword upon the table and says "God send me no<br>
need of thee" and, by the operation of the second<br>
cup, draws him on the drawer when indeed there is<br>
no need.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Am I like such a fellow?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy<br>
mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be<br>
moody, and as soon moody to be moved.<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  And what to?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Nay, an there were two such, we should<br>
have none shortly, for one would kill the other.<br>
Thou--why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that<br>
hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than<br>
thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking<br>
nuts, having no other reason but because thou<br>
hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy<br>
out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as<br>
an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been<br>
beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast<br>
quarreled with a man for coughing in the street<br>
because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain<br>
asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor<br>
for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With<br>
another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?<br>
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any<br>
man should buy the fee simple of my life for an<br>
hour and a quarter.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  The fee simple? O simple!<br>
<br>
[Enter Tybalt, Petruchio, and others.]<br>
<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  By my head, here comes the Capulets.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  By my heel, I care not.<br>
<br>
TYBALT, [to his companions]<br>
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.--<br>
Gentlemen, good e'en. A word with one of you.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  And but one word with one of us? Couple it<br>
with something. Make it a word and a blow.<br>
<br>
TYBALT  You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an<br>
you will give me occasion.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Could you not take some occasion without<br>
giving?<br>
<br>
TYBALT  Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels?<br>
An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear<br>
nothing but discords. Here's my fiddlestick; here's<br>
that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
We talk here in the public haunt of men.<br>
Either withdraw unto some private place,<br>
Or reason coldly of your grievances,<br>
Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.<br>
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.<br>
<br>
[Enter Romeo.]<br>
<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.<br>
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower.<br>
Your Worship in that sense may call him "man."<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford<br>
No better term than this: thou art a villain.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee<br>
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage<br>
To such a greeting. Villain am I none.<br>
Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries<br>
That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I do protest I never injured thee<br>
But love thee better than thou canst devise<br>
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.<br>
And so, good Capulet, which name I tender<br>
As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
O calm, dishonorable, vile submission!<br>
Alla stoccato carries it away.	[He draws.]<br>
Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?<br>
<br>
TYBALT  What wouldst thou have with me?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Good king of cats, nothing but one of your<br>
nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as<br>
you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the<br>
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher<br>
by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your<br>
ears ere it be out.<br>
<br>
TYBALT  I am for you.	[He draws.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  Come, sir, your passado.	[They fight.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Draw, Benvolio, beat down their weapons.<br>
[Romeo draws.]<br>
Gentlemen, for shame forbear this outrage!<br>
Tybalt! Mercutio! The Prince expressly hath<br>
Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.<br>
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!<br>
[Romeo attempts to beat down their rapiers.<br>
Tybalt stabs Mercutio.]<br>
<br>
PETRUCHIO  Away, Tybalt!<br>
[Tybalt, Petruchio, and their followers exit.]<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  I am hurt.<br>
A plague o' both houses! I am sped.<br>
Is he gone and hath nothing?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  What, art thou hurt?<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.<br>
Where is my page?--Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.<br>
[Page exits.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO  No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as<br>
a church door, but 'tis enough. 'Twill serve. Ask for<br>
me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I<br>
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'<br>
both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a<br>
cat, to scratch a man to death! A braggart, a rogue, a<br>
villain that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the<br>
devil came you between us? I was hurt under your<br>
arm.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  I thought all for the best.<br>
<br>
MERCUTIO<br>
Help me into some house, Benvolio,<br>
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!<br>
They have made worms' meat of me.<br>
I have it, and soundly, too. Your houses!<br>
[All but Romeo exit.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,<br>
My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt<br>
In my behalf. My reputation stained<br>
With Tybalt's slander--Tybalt, that an hour<br>
Hath been my cousin! O sweet Juliet,<br>
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate<br>
And in my temper softened valor's steel.<br>
<br>
[Enter Benvolio.]<br>
<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead.<br>
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,<br>
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
This day's black fate on more days doth depend.<br>
This but begins the woe others must end.<br>
<br>
[Enter Tybalt.]<br>
<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain!<br>
Away to heaven, respective lenity,<br>
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.--<br>
Now, Tybalt, take the "villain" back again<br>
That late thou gavest me, for Mercutio's soul<br>
Is but a little way above our heads,<br>
Staying for thine to keep him company.<br>
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.<br>
<br>
TYBALT<br>
Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here<br>
Shalt with him hence.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  This shall determine that.<br>
[They fight. Tybalt falls.]<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Romeo, away, begone!<br>
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.<br>
Stand not amazed. The Prince will doom thee death<br>
If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
O, I am Fortune's fool!<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO  Why dost thou stay?<br>
[Romeo exits.]<br>
<br>
[Enter Citizens.]<br>
<br>
<br>
CITIZEN<br>
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?<br>
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
There lies that Tybalt.<br>
<br>
CITIZEN, [to Tybalt]  Up, sir, go with me.<br>
I charge thee in the Prince's name, obey.<br>
<br>
[Enter Prince, old Montague, Capulet, their Wives and all.]<br>
<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
O noble prince, I can discover all<br>
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.<br>
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,<br>
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother's child!<br>
O prince! O cousin! Husband! O, the blood is spilled<br>
Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,<br>
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.<br>
O cousin, cousin!<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?<br>
<br>
BENVOLIO<br>
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay--<br>
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink<br>
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal<br>
Your high displeasure. All this uttered<br>
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed<br>
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen<br>
Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts<br>
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,<br>
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point<br>
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats<br>
Cold death aside and with the other sends<br>
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity<br>
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud<br>
"Hold, friends! Friends, part!" and swifter than his<br>
tongue<br>
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<br>
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm<br>
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<br>
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.<br>
But by and by comes back to Romeo,<br>
Who had but newly entertained revenge,<br>
And to 't they go like lightning, for ere I<br>
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain,<br>
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.<br>
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
He is a kinsman to the Montague.<br>
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true.<br>
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,<br>
And all those twenty could but kill one life.<br>
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.<br>
Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.<br>
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?<br>
<br>
MONTAGUE<br>
Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend.<br>
His fault concludes but what the law should end,<br>
The life of Tybalt.<br>
<br>
PRINCE  And for that offense<br>
Immediately we do exile him hence.<br>
I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding:<br>
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.<br>
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine<br>
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.<br>
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.<br>
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.<br>
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,<br>
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.<br>
Bear hence this body and attend our will.<br>
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.<br>
[They exit, the Capulet men<br>
bearing off Tybalt's body.]<br>
<br>
Scene 2<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Juliet alone.]<br>
<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,<br>
Towards Phoebus' lodging. Such a wagoner<br>
As Phaeton would whip you to the west<br>
And bring in cloudy night immediately.<br>
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,<br>
That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo<br>
Leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.<br>
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites<br>
By their own beauties, or, if love be blind,<br>
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,<br>
Thou sober-suited matron all in black,<br>
And learn me how to lose a winning match<br>
Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.<br>
Hood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,<br>
With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,<br>
Think true love acted simple modesty.<br>
Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in<br>
night,<br>
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night<br>
Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.<br>
Come, gentle night; come, loving black-browed<br>
night,<br>
Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,<br>
Take him and cut him out in little stars,<br>
And he will make the face of heaven so fine<br>
That all the world will be in love with night<br>
And pay no worship to the garish sun.<br>
O, I have bought the mansion of a love<br>
But not possessed it, and, though I am sold,<br>
Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day<br>
As is the night before some festival<br>
To an impatient child that hath new robes<br>
And may not wear them.<br>
<br>
[Enter Nurse with cords.]<br>
<br>
O, here comes my nurse,<br>
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks<br>
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.--<br>
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? The<br>
cords<br>
That Romeo bid thee fetch?<br>
<br>
NURSE  Ay, ay, the cords.<br>
[Dropping the rope ladder.]<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Ah weraday, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!<br>
We are undone, lady, we are undone.<br>
Alack the day, he's gone, he's killed, he's dead.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Can heaven be so envious?<br>
<br>
NURSE  Romeo can,<br>
Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo,<br>
Whoever would have thought it? Romeo!<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?<br>
This torture should be roared in dismal hell.<br>
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but "Ay,"<br>
And that bare vowel "I" shall poison more<br>
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.<br>
I am not I if there be such an "I,"<br>
Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "Ay."<br>
If he be slain, say "Ay," or if not, "No."<br>
Brief sounds determine my weal or woe.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
I saw the wound. I saw it with mine eyes<br>
(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast--<br>
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,<br>
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood,<br>
All in gore blood. I swooned at the sight.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O break, my heart, poor bankrout, break at once!<br>
To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty.<br>
Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,<br>
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!<br>
O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman,<br>
That ever I should live to see thee dead!<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
What storm is this that blows so contrary?<br>
Is Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt dead?<br>
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?<br>
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom,<br>
For who is living if those two are gone?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished.<br>
Romeo that killed him--he is banished.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O God, did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
It did, it did, alas the day, it did.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O serpent heart hid with a flow'ring face!<br>
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?<br>
Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical!<br>
Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!<br>
Despised substance of divinest show!<br>
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,<br>
A damned saint, an honorable villain.<br>
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell<br>
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend<br>
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?<br>
Was ever book containing such vile matter<br>
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell<br>
In such a gorgeous palace!<br>
<br>
NURSE  There's no trust,<br>
No faith, no honesty in men. All perjured,<br>
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.<br>
Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.<br>
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me<br>
old.<br>
Shame come to Romeo!<br>
<br>
JULIET  Blistered be thy tongue<br>
For such a wish! He was not born to shame.<br>
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,<br>
For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned<br>
Sole monarch of the universal Earth.<br>
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?<br>
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy<br>
name<br>
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?<br>
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?<br>
That villain cousin would have killed my husband.<br>
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;<br>
Your tributary drops belong to woe,<br>
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.<br>
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,<br>
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my<br>
husband.<br>
All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?<br>
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,<br>
That murdered me. I would forget it fain,<br>
But, O, it presses to my memory<br>
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:<br>
"Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished."<br>
That "banished," that one word "banished,"<br>
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death<br>
Was woe enough if it had ended there;<br>
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship<br>
And needly will be ranked with other griefs,<br>
Why followed not, when she said "Tybalt's dead,"<br>
"Thy father" or "thy mother," nay, or both,<br>
Which modern lamentation might have moved?<br>
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,<br>
"Romeo is banished." To speak that word<br>
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,<br>
All slain, all dead. "Romeo is banished."<br>
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,<br>
In that word's death. No words can that woe sound.<br>
Where is my father and my mother, nurse?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.<br>
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be<br>
spent,<br>
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.--<br>
Take up those cords.<br>
[The Nurse picks up the rope ladder.]<br>
Poor ropes, you are beguiled,<br>
Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.<br>
He made you for a highway to my bed,<br>
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.<br>
Come, cords--come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed,<br>
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo<br>
To comfort you. I wot well where he is.<br>
Hark you, your Romeo will be here at night.<br>
I'll to him. He is hid at Lawrence' cell.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O, find him!	[Giving the Nurse a ring.]<br>
Give this ring to my true knight<br>
And bid him come to take his last farewell.<br>
[They exit.]<br>
<br>
Scene 3<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Friar Lawrence.]<br>
<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.<br>
Affliction is enamored of thy parts,<br>
And thou art wedded to calamity.<br>
<br>
[Enter Romeo.]<br>
<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom?<br>
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand<br>
That I yet know not?<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE  Too familiar<br>
Is my dear son with such sour company.<br>
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
A gentler judgment vanished from his lips:<br>
Not body's death, but body's banishment.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say "death,"<br>
For exile hath more terror in his look,<br>
Much more than death. Do not say "banishment."<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Here from Verona art thou banished.<br>
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
There is no world without Verona walls<br>
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.<br>
Hence "banished" is "banished from the world,"<br>
And world's exile is death. Then "banished"<br>
Is death mistermed. Calling death "banished,"<br>
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax<br>
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!<br>
Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,<br>
Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law<br>
And turned that black word "death" to<br>
"banishment."<br>
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
'Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here<br>
Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog<br>
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<br>
Live here in heaven and may look on her,<br>
But Romeo may not. More validity,<br>
More honorable state, more courtship lives<br>
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize<br>
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand<br>
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<br>
Who even in pure and vestal modesty<br>
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;<br>
But Romeo may not; he is banished.<br>
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.<br>
They are free men, but I am banished.<br>
And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?<br>
Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground<br>
knife,<br>
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,<br>
But "banished" to kill me? "Banished"?<br>
O friar, the damned use that word in hell.<br>
Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,<br>
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,<br>
A sin absolver, and my friend professed,<br>
To mangle me with that word "banished"?<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
I'll give thee armor to keep off that word,<br>
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,<br>
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Yet "banished"? Hang up philosophy.<br>
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,<br>
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,<br>
It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
O, then I see that madmen have no ears.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
How should they when that wise men have no eyes?<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.<br>
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,<br>
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,<br>
Doting like me, and like me banished,<br>
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy<br>
hair<br>
And fall upon the ground as I do now,<br>
[Romeo throws himself down.]<br>
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.<br>
[Knock within.]<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Arise. One knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans,<br>
Mistlike, enfold me from the search of eyes.<br>
[Knock.]<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Hark, how they knock!--Who's there?--Romeo,<br>
arise.<br>
Thou wilt be taken.--Stay awhile.--Stand up.<br>
[Knock.]<br>
Run to my study.--By and by.--God's will,<br>
What simpleness is this?--I come, I come.<br>
[Knock.]<br>
Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's<br>
your will?<br>
<br>
NURSE, [within]<br>
Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.<br>
I come from Lady Juliet.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE, [admitting the Nurse]<br>
Welcome, then.<br>
<br>
[Enter Nurse.]<br>
<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,<br>
Where's my lady's lord? Where's Romeo?<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
There on the ground, with his own tears made<br>
drunk.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
O, he is even in my mistress' case,<br>
Just in her case. O woeful sympathy!<br>
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,<br>
Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubb'ring.--<br>
Stand up, stand up. Stand an you be a man.<br>
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand.<br>
Why should you fall into so deep an O?<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Nurse.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Ah sir, ah sir, death's the end of all.<br>
<br>
ROMEO, [rising up]<br>
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?<br>
Doth not she think me an old murderer,<br>
Now I have stained the childhood of our joy<br>
With blood removed but little from her own?<br>
Where is she? And how doth she? And what says<br>
My concealed lady to our canceled love?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps,<br>
And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,<br>
And "Tybalt" calls, and then on Romeo cries,<br>
And then down falls again.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  As if that name,<br>
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,<br>
Did murder her, as that name's cursed hand<br>
Murdered her kinsman.--O, tell me, friar, tell me,<br>
In what vile part of this anatomy<br>
Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack<br>
The hateful mansion.	[He draws his dagger.]<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE  Hold thy desperate hand!<br>
Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.<br>
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote<br>
The unreasonable fury of a beast.<br>
Unseemly woman in a seeming man,<br>
And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!<br>
Thou hast amazed me. By my holy order,<br>
I thought thy disposition better tempered.<br>
Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself,<br>
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,<br>
By doing damned hate upon thyself?<br>
Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth,<br>
Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet<br>
In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose?<br>
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,<br>
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all<br>
And usest none in that true use indeed<br>
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.<br>
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,<br>
Digressing from the valor of a man;<br>
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,<br>
Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish;<br>
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,<br>
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,<br>
Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,<br>
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,<br>
And thou dismembered with thine own defense.<br>
What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,<br>
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead:<br>
There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,<br>
But thou slewest Tybalt: there art thou happy.<br>
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend<br>
And turns it to exile: there art thou happy.<br>
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;<br>
Happiness courts thee in her best array;<br>
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,<br>
Thou pouts upon thy fortune and thy love.<br>
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.<br>
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.<br>
Ascend her chamber. Hence and comfort her.<br>
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,<br>
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,<br>
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time<br>
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,<br>
Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back<br>
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy<br>
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.--<br>
Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,<br>
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,<br>
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.<br>
Romeo is coming.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night<br>
To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!--<br>
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.<br>
[Nurse gives Romeo a ring.]<br>
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.<br>
[She exits.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
How well my comfort is revived by this!<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Go hence, good night--and here stands all your<br>
state:<br>
Either be gone before the watch be set<br>
Or by the break of day disguised from hence.<br>
Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,<br>
And he shall signify from time to time<br>
Every good hap to you that chances here.<br>
Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell. Good night.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,<br>
It were a grief so brief to part with thee.<br>
Farewell.<br>
[They exit.]<br>
<br>
Scene 4<br>
=======<br>
[Enter old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.]<br>
<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily<br>
That we have had no time to move our daughter.<br>
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,<br>
And so did I. Well, we were born to die.<br>
'Tis very late. She'll not come down tonight.<br>
I promise you, but for your company,<br>
I would have been abed an hour ago.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
These times of woe afford no times to woo.--<br>
Madam, good night. Commend me to your<br>
daughter.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow.<br>
Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender<br>
Of my child's love. I think she will be ruled<br>
In all respects by me. Nay, more, I doubt it not.--<br>
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed.<br>
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love,<br>
And bid her--mark you me?--on Wednesday<br>
next--<br>
But soft, what day is this?<br>
<br>
PARIS  Monday, my lord.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Monday, ha ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.<br>
O' Thursday let it be.--O' Thursday, tell her,<br>
She shall be married to this noble earl.--<br>
Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?<br>
We'll keep no great ado: a friend or two.<br>
For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,<br>
It may be thought we held him carelessly,<br>
Being our kinsman, if we revel much.<br>
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,<br>
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Well, get you gone. O' Thursday be it, then.<br>
[To Lady Capulet.] Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.<br>
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.--<br>
Farewell, my lord.--Light to my chamber, ho!--<br>
Afore me, it is so very late that we<br>
May call it early by and by.--Good night.<br>
[They exit.]<br>
<br>
Scene 5<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft.]<br>
<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.<br>
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,<br>
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.<br>
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.<br>
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,<br>
No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks<br>
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.<br>
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day<br>
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.<br>
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.<br>
It is some meteor that the sun exhaled<br>
To be to thee this night a torchbearer<br>
And light thee on thy way to Mantua.<br>
Therefore stay yet. Thou need'st not to be gone.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Let me be ta'en; let me be put to death.<br>
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.<br>
I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye;<br>
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow.<br>
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat<br>
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.<br>
I have more care to stay than will to go.<br>
Come death and welcome. Juliet wills it so.<br>
How is 't, my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
It is, it is. Hie hence, begone, away!<br>
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,<br>
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.<br>
Some say the lark makes sweet division.<br>
This doth not so, for she divideth us.<br>
Some say the lark and loathed toad changed eyes.<br>
O, now I would they had changed voices too,<br>
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,<br>
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.<br>
O, now begone. More light and light it grows.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.<br>
<br>
[Enter Nurse.]<br>
<br>
<br>
NURSE  Madam.<br>
<br>
JULIET  Nurse?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.<br>
The day is broke; be wary; look about.	[She exits.]<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Farewell, farewell. One kiss and I'll descend.<br>
[They kiss, and Romeo descends.]<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend!<br>
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,<br>
For in a minute there are many days.<br>
O, by this count I shall be much in years<br>
Ere I again behold my Romeo.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Farewell.<br>
I will omit no opportunity<br>
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve<br>
For sweet discourses in our times to come.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!<br>
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,<br>
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.<br>
Either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.<br>
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.	[He exits.]<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle.<br>
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him<br>
That is renowned for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,<br>
For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long,<br>
But send him back.<br>
<br>
[Enter Lady Capulet.]<br>
<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET  Ho, daughter, are you up?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Who is 't that calls? It is my lady mother.<br>
Is she not down so late or up so early?<br>
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?<br>
[Juliet descends.]<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Why, how now, Juliet?<br>
<br>
JULIET  Madam, I am not well.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?<br>
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?<br>
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.<br>
Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of<br>
love,<br>
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend<br>
Which you weep for.<br>
<br>
JULIET  Feeling so the loss,<br>
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death<br>
As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
What villain, madam?<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET  That same villain, Romeo.<br>
<br>
JULIET, [aside]<br>
Villain and he be many miles asunder.--<br>
God pardon him. I do with all my heart,<br>
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
That is because the traitor murderer lives.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.<br>
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.<br>
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,<br>
Where that same banished runagate doth live,<br>
Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram<br>
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.<br>
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied<br>
With Romeo till I behold him--dead--<br>
Is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vexed.<br>
Madam, if you could find out but a man<br>
To bear a poison, I would temper it,<br>
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,<br>
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors<br>
To hear him named and cannot come to him<br>
To wreak the love I bore my cousin<br>
Upon his body that hath slaughtered him.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.<br>
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
And joy comes well in such a needy time.<br>
What are they, beseech your Ladyship?<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child,<br>
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,<br>
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy<br>
That thou expects not, nor I looked not for.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Madam, in happy time! What day is that?<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn<br>
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,<br>
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church<br>
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Now, by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,<br>
He shall not make me there a joyful bride!<br>
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed<br>
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.<br>
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,<br>
I will not marry yet, and when I do I swear<br>
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,<br>
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,<br>
And see how he will take it at your hands.<br>
<br>
[Enter Capulet and Nurse.]<br>
<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew,<br>
But for the sunset of my brother's son<br>
It rains downright.<br>
How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?<br>
Evermore show'ring? In one little body<br>
Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.<br>
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,<br>
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,<br>
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs,<br>
Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,<br>
Without a sudden calm, will overset<br>
Thy tempest-tossed body.--How now, wife?<br>
Have you delivered to her our decree?<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks.<br>
I would the fool were married to her grave.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife.<br>
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?<br>
Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blessed,<br>
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought<br>
So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.<br>
Proud can I never be of what I hate,<br>
But thankful even for hate that is meant love.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
How, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this?<br>
"Proud," and "I thank you," and "I thank you not,"<br>
And yet "not proud"? Mistress minion you,<br>
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,<br>
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next<br>
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,<br>
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.<br>
Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!<br>
You tallow face!<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET  Fie, fie, what, are you mad?<br>
<br>
JULIET, [kneeling]<br>
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,<br>
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!<br>
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,<br>
Or never after look me in the face.<br>
Speak not; reply not; do not answer me.<br>
My fingers itch.--Wife, we scarce thought us<br>
blessed<br>
That God had lent us but this only child,<br>
But now I see this one is one too much,<br>
And that we have a curse in having her.<br>
Out on her, hilding.<br>
<br>
NURSE  God in heaven bless her!<br>
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue.<br>
Good Prudence, smatter with your gossips, go.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
I speak no treason.<br>
<br>
CAPULET  O, God 'i' g' eden!<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
May not one speak?<br>
<br>
CAPULET  Peace, you mumbling fool!<br>
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,<br>
For here we need it not.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET  You are too hot.<br>
<br>
CAPULET  God's bread, it makes me mad.<br>
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,<br>
Alone, in company, still my care hath been<br>
To have her matched. And having now provided<br>
A gentleman of noble parentage,<br>
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly ligned,<br>
Stuffed, as they say, with honorable parts,<br>
Proportioned as one's thought would wish a man--<br>
And then to have a wretched puling fool,<br>
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,<br>
To answer "I'll not wed. I cannot love.<br>
I am too young. I pray you, pardon me."<br>
But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you!<br>
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.<br>
Look to 't; think on 't. I do not use to jest.<br>
Thursday is near. Lay hand on heart; advise.<br>
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend.<br>
An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,<br>
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,<br>
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.<br>
Trust to 't; bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.<br>
[He exits.]<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds<br>
That sees into the bottom of my grief?--<br>
O sweet my mother, cast me not away.<br>
Delay this marriage for a month, a week,<br>
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed<br>
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.<br>
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.<br>
[She exits.]<br>
<br>
JULIET, [rising]<br>
O God! O nurse, how shall this be prevented?<br>
My husband is on Earth, my faith in heaven.<br>
How shall that faith return again to Earth<br>
Unless that husband send it me from heaven<br>
By leaving Earth? Comfort me; counsel me.--<br>
Alack, alack, that heaven should practice stratagems<br>
Upon so soft a subject as myself.--<br>
What sayst thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?<br>
Some comfort, nurse.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Faith, here it is.<br>
Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing<br>
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you,<br>
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<br>
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,<br>
I think it best you married with the County.<br>
O, he's a lovely gentleman!<br>
Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,<br>
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye<br>
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,<br>
I think you are happy in this second match,<br>
For it excels your first, or, if it did not,<br>
Your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were<br>
As living here and you no use of him.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Speak'st thou from thy heart?<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
And from my soul too, else beshrew them both.<br>
<br>
JULIET  Amen.<br>
<br>
NURSE  What?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.<br>
Go in and tell my lady I am gone,<br>
Having displeased my father, to Lawrence' cell<br>
To make confession and to be absolved.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.	[She exits.]<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Ancient damnation, O most wicked fiend!<br>
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn<br>
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue<br>
Which she hath praised him with above compare<br>
So many thousand times? Go, counselor.<br>
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.<br>
I'll to the Friar to know his remedy.<br>
If all else fail, myself have power to die.<br>
[She exits.]<br>
<br>

ACT 4<br>
=====<br>
<br>
Scene 1<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Friar Lawrence and County Paris.]<br>
<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
My father Capulet will have it so,<br>
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
You say you do not know the lady's mind?<br>
Uneven is the course. I like it not.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,<br>
And therefore have I little talk of love,<br>
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.<br>
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous<br>
That she do give her sorrow so much sway,<br>
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage<br>
To stop the inundation of her tears,<br>
Which, too much minded by herself alone,<br>
May be put from her by society.<br>
Now do you know the reason of this haste.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE, [aside]<br>
I would I knew not why it should be slowed.--<br>
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.<br>
<br>
[Enter Juliet.]<br>
<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Happily met, my lady and my wife.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
That "may be" must be, love, on Thursday next.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
What must be shall be.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE  That's a certain text.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Come you to make confession to this father?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
To answer that, I should confess to you.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Do not deny to him that you love me.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
I will confess to you that I love him.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
So will you, I am sure, that you love me.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
If I do so, it will be of more price<br>
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
The tears have got small victory by that,<br>
For it was bad enough before their spite.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,<br>
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
It may be so, for it is not mine own.--<br>
Are you at leisure, holy father, now,<br>
Or shall I come to you at evening Mass?<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.--<br>
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
God shield I should disturb devotion!--<br>
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you.<br>
Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.	[He exits.]<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,<br>
Come weep with me, past hope, past care, past help.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
O Juliet, I already know thy grief.<br>
It strains me past the compass of my wits.<br>
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,<br>
On Thursday next be married to this County.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Tell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,<br>
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.<br>
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,<br>
Do thou but call my resolution wise,<br>
And with this knife I'll help it presently.<br>
[She shows him her knife.]<br>
God joined my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;<br>
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's sealed,<br>
Shall be the label to another deed,<br>
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt<br>
Turn to another, this shall slay them both.<br>
Therefore out of thy long-experienced time<br>
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,<br>
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife<br>
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that<br>
Which the commission of thy years and art<br>
Could to no issue of true honor bring.<br>
Be not so long to speak. I long to die<br>
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Hold, daughter, I do spy a kind of hope,<br>
Which craves as desperate an execution<br>
As that is desperate which we would prevent.<br>
If, rather than to marry County Paris,<br>
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,<br>
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake<br>
A thing like death to chide away this shame,<br>
That cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it;<br>
And if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<br>
From off the battlements of any tower,<br>
Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk<br>
Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears,<br>
Or hide me nightly in a charnel house,<br>
O'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones,<br>
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.<br>
Or bid me go into a new-made grave<br>
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud<br>
(Things that to hear them told have made me<br>
tremble),<br>
And I will do it without fear or doubt,<br>
To live an unstained wife to my sweet love.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Hold, then. Go home; be merry; give consent<br>
To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow.<br>
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone;<br>
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.<br>
[Holding out a vial.]<br>
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<br>
And this distilling liquor drink thou off;<br>
When presently through all thy veins shall run<br>
A cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse<br>
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.<br>
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.<br>
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade<br>
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall<br>
Like death when he shuts up the day of life.<br>
Each part, deprived of supple government,<br>
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death,<br>
And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death<br>
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours<br>
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.<br>
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes<br>
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.<br>
Then, as the manner of our country is,<br>
In thy best robes uncovered on the bier<br>
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault<br>
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.<br>
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,<br>
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,<br>
And hither shall he come, and he and I<br>
Will watch thy waking, and that very night<br>
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.<br>
And this shall free thee from this present shame,<br>
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear<br>
Abate thy valor in the acting it.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE, [giving Juliet the vial]<br>
Hold, get you gone. Be strong and prosperous<br>
In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed<br>
To Mantua with my letters to thy lord.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Love give me strength, and strength shall help<br>
afford.<br>
Farewell, dear father.<br>
[They exit in different directions.]<br>
<br>
Scene 2<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,<br>
two or three.]<br>
<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
So many guests invite as here are writ.<br>
[One or two of the Servingmen exit<br>
with Capulet's list.]<br>
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  You shall have none ill, sir, for I'll try if<br>
they can lick their fingers.<br>
<br>
CAPULET  How canst thou try them so?<br>
<br>
SERVINGMAN  Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick<br>
his own fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his<br>
fingers goes not with me.<br>
<br>
CAPULET  Go, begone.	[Servingman exits.]<br>
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.--<br>
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?<br>
<br>
NURSE  Ay, forsooth.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Well, he may chance to do some good on her.<br>
A peevish self-willed harlotry it is.<br>
<br>
[Enter Juliet.]<br>
<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
How now, my headstrong, where have you been<br>
gadding?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Where I have learned me to repent the sin<br>
Of disobedient opposition<br>
To you and your behests, and am enjoined<br>
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here	[Kneeling.]<br>
To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.<br>
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Send for the County. Go tell him of this.<br>
I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell<br>
And gave him what becomed love I might,<br>
Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Why, I am glad on 't. This is well. Stand up.<br>
[Juliet rises.]<br>
This is as 't should be.--Let me see the County.<br>
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.--<br>
Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,<br>
All our whole city is much bound to him.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet<br>
To help me sort such needful ornaments<br>
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Go, nurse. Go with her. We'll to church tomorrow.<br>
[Juliet and the Nurse exit.]<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
We shall be short in our provision.<br>
'Tis now near night.<br>
<br>
CAPULET  Tush, I will stir about,<br>
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.<br>
Go thou to Juliet. Help to deck up her.<br>
I'll not to bed tonight. Let me alone.<br>
I'll play the housewife for this once.--What ho!--<br>
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself<br>
To County Paris, to prepare up him<br>
Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light<br>
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimed.<br>
[They exit.]<br>
<br>
Scene 3<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Juliet and Nurse.]<br>
<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle nurse,<br>
I pray thee leave me to myself tonight,<br>
For I have need of many orisons<br>
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,<br>
Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.<br>
<br>
[Enter Lady Capulet.]<br>
<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
No, madam, we have culled such necessaries<br>
As are behooveful for our state tomorrow.<br>
So please you, let me now be left alone,<br>
And let the Nurse this night sit up with you,<br>
For I am sure you have your hands full all<br>
In this so sudden business.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET  Good night.<br>
Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.<br>
[Lady Capulet and the Nurse exit.]<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Farewell.--God knows when we shall meet again.<br>
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins<br>
That almost freezes up the heat of life.<br>
I'll call them back again to comfort me.--<br>
Nurse!--What should she do here?<br>
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.<br>
Come, vial.	[She takes out the vial.]<br>
What if this mixture do not work at all?<br>
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?<br>
[She takes out her knife<br>
and puts it down beside her.]<br>
No, no, this shall forbid it. Lie thou there.<br>
What if it be a poison which the Friar<br>
Subtly hath ministered to have me dead,<br>
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored<br>
Because he married me before to Romeo?<br>
I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,<br>
For he hath still been tried a holy man.<br>
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,<br>
I wake before the time that Romeo<br>
Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point.<br>
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,<br>
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,<br>
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?<br>
Or, if I live, is it not very like<br>
The horrible conceit of death and night,<br>
Together with the terror of the place--<br>
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle<br>
Where for this many hundred years the bones<br>
Of all my buried ancestors are packed;<br>
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,<br>
Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,<br>
At some hours in the night spirits resort--<br>
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,<br>
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,<br>
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,<br>
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad--<br>
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,<br>
Environed with all these hideous fears,<br>
And madly play with my forefathers' joints,<br>
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,<br>
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,<br>
As with a club, dash out my desp'rate brains?<br>
O look, methinks I see my cousin's ghost<br>
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body<br>
Upon a rapier's point! Stay, Tybalt, stay!<br>
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here's drink. I drink to<br>
thee.	[She drinks and falls upon her bed<br>
within the curtains.]<br>
<br>
Scene 4<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.]<br>
<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.<br>
<br>
[Enter old Capulet.]<br>
<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crowed.<br>
The curfew bell hath rung. 'Tis three o'clock.--<br>
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica.<br>
Spare not for cost.<br>
<br>
NURSE  Go, you cot-quean, go,<br>
Get you to bed. Faith, you'll be sick tomorrow<br>
For this night's watching.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
No, not a whit. What, I have watched ere now<br>
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,<br>
But I will watch you from such watching now.<br>
[Lady Capulet and Nurse exit.]<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!<br>
<br>
[Enter three or four Servingmen with spits and logs<br>
and baskets.]<br>
<br>
Now fellow,<br>
What is there?<br>
<br>
FIRST SERVINGMAN<br>
Things for the cook, sir, but I know not what.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Make haste, make haste.	[First Servingman exits.]<br>
Sirrah, fetch drier logs.<br>
Call Peter. He will show thee where they are.<br>
<br>
SECOND SERVINGMAN<br>
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs<br>
And never trouble Peter for the matter.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Mass, and well said. A merry whoreson, ha!<br>
Thou shalt be loggerhead.<br>
[Second Servingman exits.]<br>
Good faith, 'tis day.<br>
The County will be here with music straight,<br>
[Play music.]<br>
For so he said he would. I hear him near.--<br>
Nurse!--Wife! What ho!--What, nurse, I say!<br>
<br>
[Enter Nurse.]<br>
<br>
Go waken Juliet. Go and trim her up.<br>
I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,<br>
Make haste. The bridegroom he is come already.<br>
Make haste, I say.<br>

NURSE, [approaching the bed]<br>
Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet!--Fast, I warrant<br>
her, she--<br>
Why, lamb, why, lady! Fie, you slugabed!<br>
Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!--<br>
What, not a word?--You take your pennyworths<br>
now.<br>
Sleep for a week, for the next night, I warrant,<br>
The County Paris hath set up his rest<br>
That you shall rest but little.--God forgive me,<br>
Marry, and amen! How sound is she asleep!<br>
I needs must wake her.--Madam, madam, madam!<br>
Ay, let the County take you in your bed,<br>
He'll fright you up, i' faith.--Will it not be?<br>
[She opens the bed's curtains.]<br>
What, dressed, and in your clothes, and down<br>
again?<br>
I must needs wake you. Lady, lady, lady!--<br>
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead.--<br>
O, weraday, that ever I was born!--<br>
Some aqua vitae, ho!--My lord! My lady!<br>

NURSE  O lamentable day!<br>

LADY CAPULET<br>
What is the matter?<br>

NURSE  Look, look!--O heavy day!<br>

LADY CAPULET<br>
O me! O me! My child, my only life,<br>
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.<br>
Help, help! Call help.<br>

For shame, bring Juliet forth. Her lord is come.<br>

NURSE<br>
She's dead, deceased. She's dead, alack the day!<br>

LADY CAPULET<br>
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Ha, let me see her! Out, alas, she's cold.<br>
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.<br>
Life and these lips have long been separated.<br>
Death lies on her like an untimely frost<br>
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
O lamentable day!<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET  O woeful time!<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,<br>
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.<br>

[Enter Friar Lawrence and the County Paris, with<br>
Musicians.]<br>
<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Ready to go, but never to return.--<br>
O son, the night before thy wedding day<br>
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,<br>
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.<br>
Death is my son-in-law; Death is my heir.<br>
My daughter he hath wedded. I will die<br>
And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.<br>

PARIS<br>
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,<br>
And doth it give me such a sight as this?<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!<br>
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw<br>
In lasting labor of his pilgrimage!<br>
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,<br>
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,<br>
And cruel death hath catched it from my sight!<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
O woe, O woeful, woeful, woeful day!<br>
Most lamentable day, most woeful day<br>
That ever, ever I did yet behold!<br>
O day, O day, O day, O hateful day!<br>
Never was seen so black a day as this!<br>
O woeful day, O woeful day!<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!<br>
Most detestable death, by thee beguiled,<br>
By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown!<br>
O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!<br>
Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now<br>
To murder, murder our solemnity?<br>
O child! O child! My soul and not my child!<br>
Dead art thou! Alack, my child is dead,<br>
And with my child my joys are buried.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not<br>
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself<br>
Had part in this fair maid. Now heaven hath all,<br>
And all the better is it for the maid.<br>
Your part in her you could not keep from death,<br>
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.<br>
The most you sought was her promotion,<br>
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced;<br>
And weep you now, seeing she is advanced<br>
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?<br>
O, in this love you love your child so ill<br>
That you run mad, seeing that she is well.<br>
She's not well married that lives married long,<br>
But she's best married that dies married young.<br>
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary<br>
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,<br>
And in her best array, bear her to church,<br>
For though fond nature bids us all lament,<br>
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
All things that we ordained festival<br>
Turn from their office to black funeral:<br>
Our instruments to melancholy bells,<br>
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,<br>
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,<br>
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,<br>
And all things change them to the contrary.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,<br>
And go, Sir Paris. Everyone prepare<br>
To follow this fair corse unto her grave.<br>
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill.<br>
Move them no more by crossing their high will.<br>
[All but the Nurse and the Musicians exit.]<br>
<br>
FIRST MUSICIAN<br>
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.<br>
<br>
NURSE<br>
Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,<br>
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.<br>
<br>
FIRST MUSICIAN<br>
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.<br>
[Nurse exits.]<br>
<br>
[Enter Peter.]<br>
<br>
<br>
PETER  Musicians, O musicians, "Heart's ease,"<br>
"Heart's ease." O, an you will have me live, play<br>
"Heart's ease."<br>
<br>
FIRST MUSICIAN  Why "Heart's ease?"<br>
<br>
PETER  O musicians, because my heart itself plays "My<br>
heart is full." O, play me some merry dump to<br>
comfort me.<br>
<br>
FIRST MUSICIAN  Not a dump, we. 'Tis no time to play<br>
now.<br>
<br>
PETER  You will not then?<br>
<br>
FIRST MUSICIAN  No.<br>
<br>
PETER  I will then give it you soundly.<br>
<br>
FIRST MUSICIAN  What will you give us?<br>
<br>
PETER  No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give<br>
you the minstrel.<br>
<br>
FIRST MUSICIAN  Then will I give you the<br>
serving-creature.<br>
<br>
PETER  Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on<br>
your pate. I will carry no crochets. I'll re you, I'll fa<br>
you. Do you note me?<br>
<br>
FIRST MUSICIAN  An you re us and fa us, you note us.<br>
<br>
SECOND MUSICIAN  Pray you, put up your dagger and<br>
put out your wit.<br>
<br>
PETER  Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat<br>
you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.<br>
Answer me like men.<br>
[Sings.]	When griping griefs the heart doth wound<br>
	And doleful dumps the mind oppress,<br>
	Then music with her silver sound--<br>
Why "silver sound"? Why "music with her silver<br>
sound"? What say you, Simon Catling?<br>
<br>
FIRST MUSICIAN  Marry, sir, because silver hath a<br>
sweet sound.<br>
<br>
PETER  Prates.--What say you, Hugh Rebeck?<br>
<br>
SECOND MUSICIAN  I say "silver sound" because musicians<br>
sound for silver.<br>
<br>
PETER  Prates too.--What say you, James Soundpost?<br>
<br>
THIRD MUSICIAN  Faith, I know not what to say.<br>
<br>
PETER  O, I cry you mercy. You are the singer. I will say<br>
for you. It is "music with her silver sound" because<br>
musicians have no gold for sounding:<br>
[Sings.]	Then music with her silver sound<br>
	With speedy help doth lend redress.<br>
[He exits.]<br>
<br>
FIRST MUSICIAN  What a pestilent knave is this same!<br>
<br>
SECOND MUSICIAN  Hang him, Jack. Come, we'll in<br>
here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.<br>
[They exit.]<br>

ACT 5<br>
=====<br>
<br>
Scene 1<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Romeo.]<br>
<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,<br>
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.<br>
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,<br>
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit<br>
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.<br>
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead<br>
(Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to<br>
think!)<br>
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips<br>
That I revived and was an emperor.<br>
Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed<br>
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!<br>
<br>
[Enter Romeo's man Balthasar, in riding boots.]<br>
<br>
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar?<br>
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?<br>
How doth my lady? Is my father well?<br>
How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,<br>
For nothing can be ill if she be well.<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR<br>
Then she is well and nothing can be ill.<br>
Her body sleeps in Capels' monument,<br>
And her immortal part with angels lives.<br>
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault<br>
And presently took post to tell it you.<br>
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,<br>
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Is it e'en so?--Then I deny you, stars!--<br>
Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper,<br>
And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR<br>
I do beseech you, sir, have patience.<br>
Your looks are pale and wild and do import<br>
Some misadventure.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  Tush, thou art deceived.<br>
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.<br>
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR<br>
No, my good lord.<br>
<br>
ROMEO  No matter. Get thee gone,<br>
And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.<br>
[Balthasar exits.]<br>
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.<br>
Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift<br>
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.<br>
I do remember an apothecary<br>
(And hereabouts he dwells) which late I noted<br>
In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,<br>
Culling of simples. Meager were his looks.<br>
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.<br>
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,<br>
An alligator stuffed, and other skins<br>
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves,<br>
A beggarly account of empty boxes,<br>
Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,<br>
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses<br>
Were thinly scattered to make up a show.<br>
Noting this penury, to myself I said<br>
"An if a man did need a poison now,<br>
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,<br>
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him."<br>
O, this same thought did but forerun my need,<br>
And this same needy man must sell it me.<br>
As I remember, this should be the house.<br>
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.--<br>
What ho, Apothecary!<br>
<br>
[Enter Apothecary.]<br>
<br>
<br>
APOTHECARY  Who calls so loud?<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.<br>
[He offers money.]<br>
Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have<br>
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear<br>
As will disperse itself through all the veins,<br>
That the life-weary taker may fall dead,<br>
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath<br>
As violently as hasty powder fired<br>
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.<br>
<br>
APOTHECARY<br>
Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law<br>
Is death to any he that utters them.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,<br>
And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,<br>
Need and oppression starveth in thy eyes,<br>
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.<br>
The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law.<br>
The world affords no law to make thee rich.<br>
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.<br>
<br>
APOTHECARY<br>
My poverty, but not my will, consents.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.<br>
<br>
APOTHECARY, [giving him the poison]<br>
Put this in any liquid thing you will<br>
And drink it off, and if you had the strength<br>
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.<br>
<br>
ROMEO, [handing him the money]<br>
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,<br>
Doing more murder in this loathsome world<br>
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not<br>
sell.<br>
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.<br>
Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.<br>
[Apothecary exits.]<br>
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me<br>
To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.<br>
[He exits.]<br>
<br>
Scene 2<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Friar John.]<br>
<br>
<br>
FRIAR JOHN<br>
Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!<br>
<br>
[Enter Friar Lawrence.]<br>
<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
This same should be the voice of Friar John.--<br>
Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?<br>
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.<br>
<br>
FRIAR JOHN<br>
Going to find a barefoot brother out,<br>
One of our order, to associate me,<br>
Here in this city visiting the sick,<br>
And finding him, the searchers of the town,<br>
Suspecting that we both were in a house<br>
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,<br>
Sealed up the doors and would not let us forth,<br>
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?<br>
<br>
FRIAR JOHN<br>
I could not send it--here it is again--<br>
[Returning the letter.]<br>
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,<br>
So fearful were they of infection.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,<br>
The letter was not nice but full of charge,<br>
Of dear import, and the neglecting it<br>
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence.<br>
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight<br>
Unto my cell.<br>
<br>
FRIAR JOHN<br>
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.	[He exits.]<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Now must I to the monument alone.<br>
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.<br>
She will beshrew me much that Romeo<br>
Hath had no notice of these accidents.<br>
But I will write again to Mantua,<br>
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.<br>
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!<br>
[He exits.]<br>
<br>
Scene 3<br>
=======<br>
[Enter Paris and his Page.]<br>
<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.<br>
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.<br>
Under yond yew trees lay thee all along,<br>
Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground.<br>
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread<br>
(Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)<br>
But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me<br>
As signal that thou hearest something approach.<br>
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee. Go.<br>
<br>
PAGE, [aside]<br>
I am almost afraid to stand alone<br>
Here in the churchyard. Yet I will adventure.<br>
[He moves away from Paris.]<br>
<br>
PARIS, [scattering flowers]<br>
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew<br>
(O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones!)<br>
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,<br>
Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans.<br>
The obsequies that I for thee will keep<br>
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.<br>
[Page whistles.]<br>
The boy gives warning something doth approach.<br>
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,<br>
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?<br>
What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.<br>
[He steps aside.]<br>
<br>
[Enter Romeo and Balthasar.]<br>
<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.<br>
Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning<br>
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.<br>
Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,<br>
Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof<br>
And do not interrupt me in my course.<br>
Why I descend into this bed of death<br>
Is partly to behold my lady's face,<br>
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger<br>
A precious ring, a ring that I must use<br>
In dear employment. Therefore hence, begone.<br>
But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry<br>
In what I farther shall intend to do,<br>
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint<br>
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.<br>
The time and my intents are savage-wild,<br>
More fierce and more inexorable far<br>
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR<br>
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.<br>
[Giving money.]<br>
Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR, [aside]<br>
For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.<br>
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.<br>
[He steps aside.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO, [beginning to force open the tomb]<br>
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,<br>
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,<br>
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,<br>
And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
This is that banished haughty Montague<br>
That murdered my love's cousin, with which grief<br>
It is supposed the fair creature died,<br>
And here is come to do some villainous shame<br>
To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.<br>
[Stepping forward.]<br>
Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague.<br>
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?<br>
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.<br>
Obey and go with me, for thou must die.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.<br>
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.<br>
Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone.<br>
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,<br>
Put not another sin upon my head<br>
By urging me to fury. O, begone!<br>
By heaven, I love thee better than myself,<br>
For I come hither armed against myself.<br>
Stay not, begone, live, and hereafter say<br>
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
I do defy thy commination<br>
And apprehend thee for a felon here.<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!<br>
[They draw and fight.]<br>
<br>
PAGE<br>
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.<br>
[He exits.]<br>
<br>
PARIS<br>
O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,<br>
Open the tomb; lay me with Juliet.	[He dies.]<br>
<br>
ROMEO<br>
In faith, I will.--Let me peruse this face.<br>
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!<br>
What said my man when my betossed soul<br>
Did not attend him as we rode? I think<br>
He told me Paris should have married Juliet.<br>
Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?<br>
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,<br>
To think it was so?--O, give me thy hand,<br>
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!<br>
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.--<br>
[He opens the tomb.]<br>
A grave? O, no. A lantern, slaughtered youth,<br>
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes<br>
This vault a feasting presence full of light.--<br>
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.<br>
[Laying Paris in the tomb.]<br>
How oft when men are at the point of death<br>
Have they been merry, which their keepers call<br>
A light'ning before death! O, how may I<br>
Call this a light'ning?--O my love, my wife,<br>
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,<br>
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.<br>
Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet<br>
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,<br>
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.--<br>
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?<br>
O, what more favor can I do to thee<br>
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain<br>
To sunder his that was thine enemy?<br>
Forgive me, cousin.--Ah, dear Juliet,<br>
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe<br>
That unsubstantial death is amorous,<br>
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps<br>
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br>
For fear of that I still will stay with thee<br>
And never from this palace of dim night<br>
Depart again. Here, here will I remain<br>
With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here<br>
Will I set up my everlasting rest<br>
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<br>
From this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.<br>
Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you<br>
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss<br>
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.<br>
[Kissing Juliet.]<br>
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!<br>
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<br>
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!<br>
Here's to my love. [Drinking.] O true apothecary,<br>
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.<br>
[He dies.]<br>
<br>
[Enter Friar Lawrence with lantern, crow, and spade.]<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Saint Francis be my speed! How oft tonight<br>
Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR<br>
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,<br>
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light<br>
To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,<br>
It burneth in the Capels' monument.<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR<br>
It doth so, holy sir, and there's my master,<br>
One that you love.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE  Who is it?<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR  Romeo.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
How long hath he been there?<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR  Full half an hour.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Go with me to the vault.<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR  I dare not, sir.<br>
My master knows not but I am gone hence,<br>
And fearfully did menace me with death<br>
If I did stay to look on his intents.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
Stay, then. I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.<br>
O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR<br>
As I did sleep under this yew tree here,<br>
I dreamt my master and another fought,<br>
And that my master slew him.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE, [moving toward the tomb]<br>
Romeo!--<br>
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains<br>
The stony entrance of this sepulcher?<br>
What mean these masterless and gory swords<br>
To lie discolored by this place of peace?<br>
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?<br>
And steeped in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour<br>
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!<br>
The lady stirs.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
O comfortable friar, where is my lord?<br>
I do remember well where I should be,<br>
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
I hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest<br>
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.<br>
A greater power than we can contradict<br>
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.<br>
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,<br>
And Paris, too. Come, I'll dispose of thee<br>
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.<br>
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.<br>
Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.<br>
[He exits.]<br>
What's here? A cup closed in my true love's hand?<br>
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.--<br>
O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop<br>
To help me after! I will kiss thy lips.<br>
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,<br>
To make me die with a restorative.	[She kisses him.]<br>
Thy lips are warm!<br>
<br>
[Enter Paris's Page and Watch.]<br>
<br>
<br>
FIRST WATCH  Lead, boy. Which way?<br>
<br>
JULIET<br>
Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O, happy dagger,<br>
This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.<br>
[She takes Romeo's dagger, stabs herself, and dies.]<br>
<br>
PAGE<br>
This is the place, there where the torch doth burn.<br>
<br>
FIRST WATCH<br>
The ground is bloody.--Search about the<br>
churchyard.<br>
Go, some of you; whoe'er you find, attach.<br>
[Some watchmen exit.]<br>
Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,<br>
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,<br>
Who here hath lain this two days buried.--<br>
Go, tell the Prince. Run to the Capulets.<br>
Raise up the Montagues. Some others search.<br>
[Others exit.]<br>
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,<br>
But the true ground of all these piteous woes<br>
We cannot without circumstance descry.<br>
<br>
[Enter Watchmen with Romeo's man Balthasar.]<br>
<br>
<br>
SECOND WATCH<br>
Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the<br>
churchyard.<br>
<br>
FIRST WATCH<br>
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.<br>
<br>
[Enter Friar Lawrence and another Watchman.]<br>
<br>
<br>
THIRD WATCH<br>
Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.<br>
We took this mattock and this spade from him<br>
As he was coming from this churchyard's side.<br>
<br>
FIRST WATCH<br>
A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.<br>
<br>
[Enter the Prince with Attendants.]<br>
<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
What misadventure is so early up<br>
That calls our person from our morning rest?<br>
<br>
[Enter Capulet and Lady Capulet.]<br>
<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
O, the people in the street cry "Romeo,"<br>
Some "Juliet," and some "Paris," and all run<br>
With open outcry toward our monument.<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
What fear is this which startles in our ears?<br>
<br>
FIRST WATCH<br>
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,<br>
And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,<br>
Warm and new killed.<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder<br>
comes.<br>
<br>
FIRST WATCH<br>
Here is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo's man,<br>
With instruments upon them fit to open<br>
These dead men's tombs.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!<br>
This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house<br>
Is empty on the back of Montague,<br>
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.<br>
<br>
LADY CAPULET<br>
O me, this sight of death is as a bell<br>
That warns my old age to a sepulcher.<br>
<br>
[Enter Montague.]<br>
<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
Come, Montague, for thou art early up<br>
To see thy son and heir now early down.<br>
<br>
MONTAGUE<br>
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.<br>
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath.<br>
What further woe conspires against mine age?<br>
<br>
PRINCE  Look, and thou shalt see.<br>
<br>
MONTAGUE, [seeing Romeo dead]<br>
O thou untaught! What manners is in this,<br>
To press before thy father to a grave?<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
Seal up the mouth of outrage for awhile,<br>
Till we can clear these ambiguities<br>
And know their spring, their head, their true<br>
descent,<br>
And then will I be general of your woes<br>
And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,<br>
And let mischance be slave to patience.--<br>
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
I am the greatest, able to do least,<br>
Yet most suspected, as the time and place<br>
Doth make against me, of this direful murder.<br>
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge<br>
Myself condemned and myself excused.<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.<br>
<br>
FRIAR LAWRENCE<br>
I will be brief, for my short date of breath<br>
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.<br>
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,<br>
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.<br>
I married them, and their stol'n marriage day<br>
Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death<br>
Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city,<br>
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.<br>
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br>
Betrothed and would have married her perforce<br>
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,<br>
And with wild looks bid me devise some mean<br>
To rid her from this second marriage,<br>
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br>
Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)<br>
A sleeping potion, which so took effect<br>
As I intended, for it wrought on her<br>
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo<br>
That he should hither come as this dire night<br>
To help to take her from her borrowed grave,<br>
Being the time the potion's force should cease.<br>
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br>
Was stayed by accident, and yesternight<br>
Returned my letter back. Then all alone<br>
At the prefixed hour of her waking<br>
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,<br>
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell<br>
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.<br>
But when I came, some minute ere the time<br>
Of her awakening, here untimely lay<br>
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br>
She wakes, and I entreated her come forth<br>
And bear this work of heaven with patience.<br>
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,<br>
And she, too desperate, would not go with me<br>
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br>
All this I know, and to the marriage<br>
Her nurse is privy. And if aught in this<br>
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br>
Be sacrificed some hour before his time<br>
Unto the rigor of severest law.<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
We still have known thee for a holy man.--<br>
Where's Romeo's man? What can he say to this?<br>
<br>
BALTHASAR<br>
I brought my master news of Juliet's death,<br>
And then in post he came from Mantua<br>
To this same place, to this same monument.<br>
This letter he early bid me give his father<br>
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,<br>
If I departed not and left him there.<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
Give me the letter. I will look on it.--<br>
[He takes Romeo's letter.]<br>
Where is the County's page, that raised the<br>
watch?--<br>
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?<br>
<br>
PAGE<br>
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave<br>
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.<br>
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,<br>
And by and by my master drew on him,<br>
And then I ran away to call the watch.<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
This letter doth make good the Friar's words,<br>
Their course of love, the tidings of her death;<br>
And here he writes that he did buy a poison<br>
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal<br>
Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.<br>
Where be these enemies?--Capulet, Montague,<br>
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,<br>
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,<br>
And I, for winking at your discords too,<br>
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.<br>
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more<br>
Can I demand.<br>
<br>
MONTAGUE  But I can give thee more,<br>
For I will ray her statue in pure gold,<br>
That whiles Verona by that name is known,<br>
There shall no figure at such rate be set<br>
As that of true and faithful Juliet.<br>
<br>
CAPULET<br>
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie,<br>
Poor sacrifices of our enmity.<br>
<br>
PRINCE<br>
A glooming peace this morning with it brings.<br>
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.<br>
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things.<br>
Some shall be pardoned, and some punished.<br>
For never was a story of more woe<br>
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.<br>
