# Gaussian Noise Baseline (FiLM x₀-prediction) — Experiment Notes

## 2026-02-17 — Config created

- FiLM-conditioned UNet, x₀ prediction, standard Gaussian noise
- Baseline comparison for noise strategy experiments
- Config validated via dry-run
- Not yet trained as a standalone experiment (existing Gaussian models
  were trained outside the experiment framework)
