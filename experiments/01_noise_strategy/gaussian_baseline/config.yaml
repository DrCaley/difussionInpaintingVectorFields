# Gaussian noise baseline — overrides only what differs from base template
# Run: PYTHONPATH=. python experiments/run_experiment.py experiments/01_noise_strategy/gaussian_baseline/config.yaml

model_name: gaussian_x0pred_film_t250
noise_function: gaussian

# Gaussian doesn't need unified z-score, but "auto" handles this correctly.
# Explicitly set to confirm awareness:
# standardizer_type: auto   (inherits from base)
