# Vanilla RePaint with Gaussian noise — attention-enhanced UNet
# Same as repaint_gaussian but using MyUNet_Attn which adds:
#   - Residual blocks (skip connections within each block)
#   - Multi-head self-attention at 16×32 and 8×16 resolutions
#   - GroupNorm + AdaGN time conditioning
# Tests whether long-range spatial awareness improves RePaint inpainting.
