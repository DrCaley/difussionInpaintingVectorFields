# DPS Guided Inpainting — Gaussian Attention Model
#
# Inference-only experiment using Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS)
# from Chung et al. (arxiv 2209.14687) as an alternative to RePaint.
#
# Model: repaint_gaussian_attn (MyUNet_Attn, epoch 132, Gaussian noise)
# Checkpoint: experiments/02_inpaint_algorithm/repaint_gaussian_attn/results/
#             inpaint_gaussian_t250_best_checkpoint.pt
#
# DPS replaces RePaint's copy-paste with soft gradient guidance:
#   x_{t-1} = x_{t-1}^pred - ζ * ∇_xt ||y - A(x̂_0)||^2
# where y = known observations, A = masking operator, x̂_0 = denoised estimate.
#
# Best config (100-sample eval):
#   boundary=2.0, div=0.0, GP warm start t=75
#   → 88/100 wins, 0.800x GP avg
