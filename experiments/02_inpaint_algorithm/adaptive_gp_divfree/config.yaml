# Adaptive GP-Refined RePaint with Div-Free Noise + CG Projection
# Uses the converged repaint_cg model (standard UNet, eps-prediction,
# forward_diff_div_free noise, 357 epochs, test loss 0.003686).
#
# This is an INFERENCE-ONLY experiment — no training needed.
# The model is unconditional (2ch), trained in repaint_cg/.
#
# Inpainting algorithm: repaint_gp_init_adaptive()
#   - GP posterior variance → spatially-varying noise weight
#   - CG streamfunction projection at every step
#   - Noise: forward_diff_div_free (matching training)
#   - Best practices from Gaussian experiments: t=75, r=5, noise_floor=0.2
